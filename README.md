We've created two templates connecting the front-end to a back-end Google Spreadsheet using [tabletop.js.] (https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) They can be customized by developers, and reporters can add content and images in a Google Spreadsheet and all changes will be reflected in real time. This is ideal for breaking news situations.

Reporters can also change titles, explainer text and credits. In addition, the database has a timestamp that chronicles the last time a reporter updated the database.

##### ... Which is powered through [this Spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jn4I3FIerKG5UGJSq3c3bEDs_V_9OxIGUnJ-Bu-3vEQ/edit#gid=0)

There's also a filter button and search option for the readers that brings up certain data. The transitions were created using [Isotope.js.] (http://isotope.metafizzy.co)
