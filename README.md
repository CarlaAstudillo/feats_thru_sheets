# Breaking News: People Database
An interactive, filterable, searchable database of people used for breaking news situations.

Here it version 1.0 in action: http://www.ibtimes.com/who-are-paris-terrorists-suspects-identified-plus-everything-we-know-2191815

Right now, it is only updated by the IBT Viz team through code, but in the future, we're planning on connecting it to a Google Spreadsheet powered by Tabletop.js, so that our reporters can update it from their end.
